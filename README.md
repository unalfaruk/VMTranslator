Java (or C#) compilers generate code written in an intermediate language called bytecode (or IL). This code is designed to run on a virtual machine architecture like the JVM (or CLR). One way to implement such VM programs is to translate them further into lower-level programs written in the machine language of some concrete (rather than virtual) host computer. In this project, we build such a VM translator, designed to translate programs written in the VM language into programs written in the Hack assembly language.
